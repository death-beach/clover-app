# Security Guide

This document outlines the security practices, considerations, and compliance requirements for the Clover USDC Payment Gateway.

## Security Model

### Authentication Security

1. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Required for admin access
   - Hardware key support
   - Backup codes provided

2. **Session Management**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Regular token rotation
   - Secure cookie handling
   ```typescript
   const sessionConfig = {
     httpOnly: true,
     secure: true,
     sameSite: 'strict',
     maxAge: 3600 // 1 hour
   };
   ```

3. **Role-Based Access**
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular permission audits
   - Role inheritance controls

### Data Security

1. **Encryption At Rest**
   - AES-256 encryption
   - Secure key management
   - Regular key rotation

2. **Data in Transit**
   - TLS 1.3 required
   - Strong cipher suites
   - Certificate management
   ```nginx
   ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
   ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
   ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   - Encrypted connections
   - Regular security patches
   - Access control lists

### Network Security

1. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Restricted port access
   - IP whitelisting
   - DDoS protection

2. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation
   - CORS policies
   ```typescript
   const securityHeaders = {
     'Content-Security-Policy': 'default-src \'self\'',
     'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
     'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff'
   };
   ```

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Security

- Privacy by design
- Data retention policies
- Subject access rights

## Incident Response

### 1. Response Plan

1. **Detection**
   - Automated monitoring
   - Alert thresholds
   - Incident classification

2. **Containment**
   - Immediate actions
   - System isolation
   - Evidence preservation

3. **Eradication**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Vulnerability patching
   - System hardening

4. **Recovery**
   - Service restoration
   - Data verification
   - System monitoring
