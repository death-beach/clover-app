interface UserPermissions {
  role: UserRole;
  merchantId: string;

}
```

### Permission Checks
```typescript
interface PermissionCheck {
  canProcessPayments: boolean;
  canViewTransactions: boolean;
  canManageUsers: boolean;
  canConfigureSystem: boolean;
  canAccessFinancials: boolean;
}
```

## Access Control Matrix

| Permission                  | Owner | Admin | Manager | Employee |

| Process Payments           | ✓     | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |
| View All Transactions      | ✓     | ✓      | ✓       | -        |
| View Own Transactions      | ✓     | ✓      | ✓       | ✓        |

## Security Considerations

### Role Validation
- Roles are validated on every request
- Changes to roles require re-authentication
- Role assignments are logged
- Regular role audits performed

### Permission Inheritance
- Permissions cascade down from higher roles
- Explicit denials override inheritance
- Custom permissions not supported
- Role changes logged for audit

### Access Restrictions
- IP-based restrictions available
- Time-based access controls
- Session management
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

## Audit Trail

### Logged Actions
- Role assignments
- Permission changes
- Access attempts
- Critical operations
- System configuration changes

### Audit Data
```typescript
interface AuditLog {
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
  action: string;
  details: object;
  ipAddress: string;
  success: boolean;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Assign minimum required permissions
   - Regular permission reviews
   - Remove unused access
   - Time-limited elevated access

2. **Role Management**
   - Document role changes
   - Regular access reviews
   - Clear approval process
   - Role delegation rules

3. **Security Measures**
   - Session timeouts
   - Concurrent session limits
   - Failed attempt lockouts
   - Regular security audits
