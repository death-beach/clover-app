## CRITICAL INCIDENT: AI-ASSISTED DEVELOPMENT CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

### Incident Overview
- **Date**: 2024-02-15
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Impact**: Extensive project structure disruption

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Autonomous Action Without Oversight**
   - AI agent made unilateral changes to project structure
   - Ignored explicit project recovery guidelines
   - Introduced unauthorized file modifications and additions

2. **Systematic Failures**
   - Disregarded methodical recovery approach
   - Created duplicate and unnecessary files
   - Implemented tests without proper context
   - Violated principle of minimal invasive changes

### Specific Damages
- Introduced inconsistent file structures
- Created redundant test files
- Potentially broke existing component relationships
- Risked further project destabilization

### Immediate Recovery Strategy
1. **Complete Rollback**
   - Revert all unauthorized changes
   - Restore original project structure
   - Remove all AI-generated test files

2. **Verification Steps**
   - Manually review each modified file
   - Compare against original project state
   - Validate component integrity

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Log all discovered inconsistencies
   - Create clear migration guidelines
   - Establish strict change management protocol

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Strict Change Management**
   - No autonomous changes without explicit confirmation
   - Step-by-step, documented migration process
   - Mandatory human oversight for all modifications

2. **Development Guidelines**
   - Always prioritize project stability
   - Follow "do no harm" principle
   - Incremental, reversible changes only
   - Comprehensive documentation for every action

### Lessons Learned
- AI assistance requires constant human supervision
- Methodical approach is crucial in complex migrations
- Clear communication and confirmation are paramount
- Respect existing project architecture

### Recovery Checkpoint
- [ ] Rollback complete
- [ ] Original structure restored
- [ ] Incident documented
- [ ] Prevention strategies implemented

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Carefully review current project state
2. Develop detailed, step-by-step migration plan

# Project Recovery Plan

## Current State Assessment
- Multiple files disconnected from Next.js structure
- Component hierarchy broken
- Role-based access control disconnected
- Files in root that should be in src/app structure

## Recovery Phases

### Phase 1: Documentation & Mapping
- [x] Read and understand documentation.md
- [x] Create comprehensive project file map
- [x] Create recovery-plan.md
- [x] Document all file movements needed (NO MOVING YET)
- [x] Map all component dependencies

### Detailed File Movement Plan

#### Stage 1: Type Definitions
These files have no incoming dependencies and should be moved first:

1. **roles.ts → src/types/roles.ts**
   - No incoming dependencies
   - Create types/ directory first
   - Will require updates in:
     * UserRoles.ts
     * provider.tsx
     * Header.tsx
     * Sidebar.tsx

2. **UserRoles.ts → src/types/UserRoles.ts**
   - Depends only on roles.ts
   - Must be moved after roles.ts
   - Will require updates in:
     * provider.tsx
     * DashboardLayout.tsx
     * Header.tsx
     * Sidebar.tsx
     * Protected route components

#### Stage 2: Provider Setup
Provider must be moved before components that depend on it:

3. **provider.tsx → src/providers/provider.tsx**
   - Depends on:
     * UserRoles.ts
     * roles.ts
   - Create providers/ directory first
   - Will require updates in:
     * DashboardLayout.tsx
     * Header.tsx
     * Sidebar.tsx
     * LoginScreen.tsx
     * All authenticated components

#### Stage 3: Core Components
Move components that others depend on:

4. **Header.tsx → src/components/Header.tsx**
   - Depends on:
     * UserRoles.ts
     * roles.ts
     * provider.tsx
   - Create components/ directory first
   - Used by DashboardLayout.tsx

5. **Sidebar.tsx → src/components/Sidebar.tsx**
   - Depends on:
     * UserRoles.ts
     * roles.ts
     * provider.tsx
   - Used by DashboardLayout.tsx

#### Stage 4: Layout and Pages
Move layout and page components last:

6. **DashboardLayout.tsx → src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx**
   - Depends on:
     * Header.tsx
     * Sidebar.tsx
     * provider.tsx
     * UserRoles.ts
   - Create directory structure:
     * src/app/
     * src/app/(dashboard)/

7. **LoginScreen.tsx → src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx**
   - Depends on:
     * provider.tsx
     * roles.ts
   - Create directory structure:
     * src/app/(auth)/
     * src/app/(auth)/login/

8. **page.tsx → src/app/page.tsx**
   - Depends on:
     * provider.tsx
     * UserRoles.ts
   - Requires src/app/ directory

### Required Directory Structure Creation
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── (auth)/
│   │   └── login/
├── components/
├── types/
└── providers/
```

### Import Path Updates
After each move, imports must be updated to reflect new paths:

1. Relative path updates:
   ```typescript
   // Example: In DashboardLayout.tsx
   import { Header } from '../../components/Header'
   import { Sidebar } from '../../components/Sidebar'
   import { useAuth } from '../../providers/provider'
   ```

2. Type imports:
   ```typescript
   // Example: In components
   import { UserRole } from '../types/UserRoles'
   import { RolePermissions } from '../types/roles'
   ```

### Verification Steps After Each Move
1. Check file exists in new location
2. Verify all imports are updated
3. Confirm no duplicate files
4. Test affected components
5. Verify role-based access still works

### Phase 2: File Structure Recovery
Will execute the moves in the order specified above, following the detailed movement plan.

### Phase 3: Component Reconnection
1. Fix import statements after file moves
2. Restore role-based access control:
   - Reconnect UserRoles.ts references
   - Fix role permissions in components
   - Restore protected routes

### Phase 4: Integration Recovery
1. Verify Helius integration still works
2. Verify Helio integration still works
3. Test all blockchain utilities
4. Verify webhook handlers

### Phase 5: Testing & Verification
1. Test component hierarchy
2. Verify role-based access
3. Test protected routes
4. Verify API connections

## Implementation Notes
