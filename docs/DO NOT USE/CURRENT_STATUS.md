## Current Build Error
```
Build Error
Next.js (15.1.7)
Failed to compile

./src/components/auth/index.ts
Error: Failed to read source code from /Users/deathbeach/Documents/POS_Payments_App/src/components/auth/index.ts

Caused by:
    No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

## Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Restore Authentication Components
1. Restore src/components/auth/ directory with:
   - index.ts (causing current build error)
   - ProtectedRoute component
   - Authentication UI components
   - Role-based access control components

### Phase 2: Restore Navigation
1. Restore src/components/DashboardNav.tsx
2. Verify integration with CloverSessionProvider
3. Ensure proper role-based navigation

### Phase 3: Verification
1. Verify layout.tsx files are properly configured
2. Test authentication flow
3. Validate Clover role integration
4. Test protected routes
5. Verify navigation functionality

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
1. Test Privy authentication
2. Test Clover OAuth
3. Verify role-based access
4. Test dashboard functionality

## Next Steps
1. Request permission to restore src/components/auth/
2. Request permission to restore DashboardNav.tsx
3. Verify each component after restoration
4. Test full authentication and navigation flow

## Important Notes
- NO files will be created, modified, or deleted without explicit permission
- Each step requires verification before proceeding
- All changes must align with SALVAGE_PLAN.md and LOCKED_PRD.md
- Focus on restoring only proven working components
